# VoiceVault 🎙️

- VoiceVault is a decentralized platform for creating, owning, and monetizing AI voice models. 
- Upload your voice, train custom AI models, and trade voice NFTs on the Aptos blockchain.

Consumers who want to license a voice have no transparent, decentralized marketplace: rights, payments, and usage-tracking are opaque.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
